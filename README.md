2. To-do page:
A user where make To-do lists. Multiple select is available.

<img src="/images/DailyTaskMain.jpg"/>

When the timer is finished, the app will alert the phone and send a notification (Timer and notification are working in the background therefore even if the app is closed, it will still work)

All the planners can be modified by users. (Add, delete and edit)
